    "description": "The Faboideae are a subfamily of the flowering plant family Fabaceae or Leguminosae. An acceptable alternative name for the subfamily is Papilionoideae, or Papilionaceae when this group of plants is treated as a family.\n\nThis subfamily is widely distributed, and members are adapted to a wide variety of environments. Faboideae may be trees, shrubs, or herbaceous plants. Members include the pea, the sweet pea, the laburnum, and other legumes. The pea-shaped flowers are characteristic of the Faboideae subfamily and root nodulation is very common. The papilionaceous species vary enormously in size from the tiny Lupinus uncialis only 2 cm in height to Pterocarpus mildbraedii subsp. usumbarensis at up to 75 m (246 ft) height.",

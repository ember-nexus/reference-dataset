    "description": "Caryophyllales (/ˌkæri.oʊfɪˈleɪliːz/ KARR-ee-oh-fih-LAY-leez) is a diverse and heterogeneous order of flowering plants with well-known members including cacti, carnations, beets, quinoa, spinach, amaranths, pigfaces and ice plants, oraches and saltbushes, goosefoots, sundews, Venus flytraps, monkey cup pitcher plants, Malabar spinach, bougainvilleas, four o'clock flowers, buckwheat, knotweeds, rhubarb, sorrel, portulacas, jojoba, and tamarisks. Many members are succulent, having fleshy stems or leaves.\n\nThe betalain pigments are unique in plants of this order and occur in all its core families with the exception of Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae. Noncore families, such as Nepenthaceae, instead produce anthocyanins. In its modern definition, the order encompasses a whole new group of families (formerly included in the order Polygonales) that never synthesize betalains, among which several families are carnivorous (like Nepenthaceae and Droseraceae).\n\nAccording to molecular clock calculations, the lineage that led to Caryophyllales split from other plants about 111 million years ago.",

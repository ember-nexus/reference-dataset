    "description": "Aquilegia, commonly known as columbines, is a genus of perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae (buttercups). The genus includes between 80 and 400 taxa (described species and subspecies) with natural ranges across the Northern Hemisphere. Natural and introduced populations of Aquilegia exist on all continents but Antarctica. Known for their high physical variability and ease of hybridization, columbines are popular garden plants and have been used to create many cultivated varieties.\n\nAquilegia typically possess stiff stems and leaves divide into multiple leaflets. Columbines often have colorful flowers with five sepals and five petals. The petals generally feature nectar spurs which differ in lengths between species. In North America, morphological variations in spurs evolved to suit different pollinators. Some species and varieties of columbines are naturally spurless. In cultivation, varieties bearing significantly altered physical traits such as double flowering are prevalent.\n\nAssociated with fertility goddesses in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, archeological evidence suggests Aquilegia were in cultivation by the 2nd century AD in Roman Britain. Despite often being toxic, columbines have been used by humans as herbal remedies, perfume, and food. Asian traditional medicine, Indigenous North Americans, and Medieval Europeans have considered portions of the plants to have medicinal uses. Selective breeding and hybridization of columbines has occurred for centuries, with exchanges between Old and New World species creating further diversity.",

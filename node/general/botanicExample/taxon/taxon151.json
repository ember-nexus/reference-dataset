    "description": "Lilium (/ˈlɪliəm/ LIL-ee-əm) is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants growing from bulbs, all with large and often prominent flowers. Lilies are a group of flowering plants which are important in culture and literature in much of the world. Most species are native to the Northern Hemisphere and their range is temperate climates and extends into the subtropics. Many other plants have \"lily\" in their common names, but do not belong to the same genus and are therefore not true lilies. True lilies are known to be highly toxic to cats.",

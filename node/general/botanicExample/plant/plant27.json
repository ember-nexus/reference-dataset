    "description": "Pelargonium (/\\u02ccp\\u025bl\\u0251\\u02d0r\\u02c8\\u0261o\\u028ani.\\u0259m/)[5] is a genus of flowering plants that includes about 280 species of perennials, succulents, and shrubs,[4] commonly called geraniums, pelargoniums, or storksbills. Geranium is also the botanical name and common name of a separate genus of related plants, also known as cranesbills. Both genera belong to the family Geraniaceae, and Carl Linnaeus originally included all the species in one genus, Geranium; they were later separated into two genera by Charles Louis L'H\\u00e9ritier de Brutelle in 1789.",

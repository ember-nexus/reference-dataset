    "description": "Magenta (/m\\u0259\\u02c8d\\u0292\\u025bnt\\u0259/) is a purple-red color.[2][3] On color wheels of the RGB (additive) and CMY (subtractive) color models, it is located precisely midway between blue and red. It is one of the four colors of ink used in color printing by most color printers, along with yellow, cyan, and black to make all the other colors. The tone of magenta used in printing, printer's magenta, is redder than the magenta of the RGB (additive) model, the former being closer to rose.\n\nMagenta took its name from an aniline dye made and patented in 1859 by the French chemist Fran\\u00e7ois-Emmanuel Verguin, who originally called it fuchsine. It was renamed to celebrate the French-Sardinian victory under French Emperor Napoleon III at the Battle of Magenta against the larger army of the Austrian Empire on 4 June 1859 near the Italian town of Magenta, at the time in Austria. This battle was decisive in liberating Italy from Austrian domination.[4][5]\n\nA virtually identical color, called roseine, was created in 1860 by two British chemists, Edward Chambers Nicholson, and George Maule.\n\nThe web color magenta is also called fuchsia.",

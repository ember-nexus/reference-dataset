    "description": "Teal is a dark cyan color. Its name comes from that of a bird\\u2014the Eurasian teal (Anas crecca)\\u2014which presents a similarly colored stripe on its head. The word is often used colloquially to refer to shades of cyan in general.\n\nIt can be created by mixing cyan into a green base, or deepened as needed with black or gray.[2] It is also one of the first group of 16 HTML/CSS web colors. In the RGB model used to create colors on computer screens and televisions, teal is created by reducing the brightness of cyan to about one half.\n\nIn North America, teal became a fad color during the 1990s, with many sports teams adopting it for their uniforms.[3][4]",
